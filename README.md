# EmoTracker pack for the Golden Sun: The Lost Age Randomizer

(originally by MarvinXLII)

This is an automated tracker for the Golden Sun: The Lost Age
randomizer, tracking key items, psynergy, summons, and djinn.

**NOTE:** This version of the tracker pack is now deprecated and will no longer receive updates. The new version can be found at https://github.com/Karanum/gstla_emotracker_pack.

## Requirements

This tracker requires [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/). Autotracking has only been tested on Bizhawk.

## Installation

At the time of writing, there are no official releases to download
from EmoTracker's package manager. This tracker must be installed from
source. To do so:

1. Either clone this repository or download and unzip a ZIP file in the directory ``Documents\EmoTracker\packs``.
2. Open EmoTracker and update the installed packages. (The only way I could do this was by downloading an official release of some other tracker. There might be other ways.)

## Acknowledgments

This tracker has been adapted from variuous existing packs, including
Pokemon Red and Blue, The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap, and Final
Fantasy IV and V.
